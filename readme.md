This project involves writing a BMP library from scratch that allows for creating and reading existing BMP files accordingly

The creation of new bitmap files is done following the specifications on wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMP_file_format)

This project was originally written in C# but I decided to port it over to C++ as it felt more fitting and I also wanted to try something new

I will update the readme whenever I see fit

TODO LIST:
- Make it work with DIB Types that arent just BITMAPINFOHEADER
- Add a way to generate "Patterns" in images or at least have pixel values influence each other to create gradients or similar
- Add a lot of error handling and general safety improvements
